Pine Game Framework
=====================
The Pine Game Framework is a general, lightweight, header-only library, which is designed to make organisation of a game much simpler.

Requirements
-----------
This library is written in C++11, and requires some of it's features.

Here are the supported compilers:
- clang 3.1
- Apple Clang Version 4.1 (LLVM 3.1svn)

Dependencies
------------
NONE! Other than the C++11's features that are used. I'm not going to list them, but if your compiler doesn't use C++11, I suggest getting a new compiler ;). Or if you just can't use C++11, then I suggest you do some negotiating or port this library to C++98/03 ;).

Installation and Usage 
----------------------
To install the library, simply drop and drag the headers into your project file (or reference to them on your local system). Since this library is header-only, there is no need to compile :)

Tutorials on how to use the framework are on the wiki. Documentation is provided with the library.
